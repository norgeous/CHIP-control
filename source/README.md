*Concept behind:* **this starter is an easy to understand and ready to use ReactJS (ES6) + bootstrap + webpack starter with:**
- `no hard core Webpack` config so it is more commonly understandable (*they are numerous amazing starters with incredible webpack configs — hard core configs aren't bad things at all! —. This one is just for easier understanding for people even discovering webpack*)
- `with hot reload` (*ReactJS + webpack => hot reload = WINNER*)
- `no flux` (*yes, to give you freedom to add then since you may want to use something else like observables?*)
- `no auth` (*simple starter that even fits for simple applications that don't need auth*)
- *ReactJS Components written with `optimization tricks` (stateless, pure render...).*

## Breaking change since v0.5.0

`ReactJS` `v15.4.x` requires `react-hot-loader` to be `v3+` (*previous react-hot-loader was v1.x*).
So This starter had to include breaking changes to follow all of that.
